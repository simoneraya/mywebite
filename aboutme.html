            <p>Thank you for checking out my website! I am a Toronto born, New York based student pursuing a dual MA/MSc degree in International History at Columbia and the London School of Economics. I recently graduated from McGill University where I studied history, political science, and South Asian studies. My interdisciplinary degree sparked my thematic interest in democracy development in differing contexts with a particular interest in foreign policy. I was fascinated by the comparative histories of The United States and South Asia and was eager to continue my studies at the graduate level in a program that emphasized international dynamics and relations.</p>
            <p>As a critical thinker, I am deeply passionate about exploring historical events and understanding their profound impact on our modern world. I find fulfillment in investigating historical narratives, deconstructing accepted viewpoints, and challenging conventional wisdom to develop a more nuanced and informed perspective.</p>
            <p>At Columbia, I have strengthened my research skills in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Archive, where I deepened my ability to manage and interpret complex qualitative and quantitative data for historical analysis and synthesis. My experience in the field of International History has ingrained a methodological approach to problem solving and an ability to analyze intricate issues. The task of the Master’s dissertation has strengthened my independence as a thinker; it has challenged me to not only create new scholarly ideas but also work independently. The majority of my work has been focused on writing and a writing-thinking approach to knowledge production. I have developed advanced skills in organization, argumentation, criticality, and time management in my writing process.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy reading, traveling, movies, and engaging in thought-provoking discussions. I am driven by a desire to better understand global processes and historical cycles. This website serves as a portfolio of my research interests, professional experiences, and some of my thoughts published on the blog section.</p>
