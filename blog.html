                        <h2>Very Mindful, Very Demure: The Meme of the Summer and What It Tells Us About Viralization </h2></p>
                            <h3>August 26, 2024</h3>
                        <p>This summer’s viral meme, “Very Mindful, Very Demure,” took over social media, popularized by TikTok creator Jools Lebron. Despite its lack of substance, the phrase gained momentum simply because it went viral—a phenomenon I call viralization, a sort of fetishization of the viral.

This era saw a rise in anti-immigration laws rooted in eugenics and a retreat from progressivism, reinforcing racial hierachies and a vision of a homogenous white America. A century later, the 2024 presidential election reflects a strikingly similar narrative. As demographic shifts continue to challenge idealized traditional identities, conservative and nationalist ideologies have resurged, echoing the rhetoric of the 1920s with a modern twist, but with the same underlying message: a resistance to diversity and a desire to maintain cultural and racial homogeneity.   </p>
