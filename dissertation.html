                <h2>The Dissertation</h2>
                <p>The dissertation forms a core part of the double degree, and is a significant undertaking in the International and World History MA/MSc program. The process begins upon entry at Columbia, working closely with faculty members across departments to develop a working thesis. A literature review is then conducted to ensure the students have read the entire field and can situate their argument within the existing literature. The four month summer period is then used for multi-archival primary research. I was a recipient of the Columbia University Alliance Fellowship - a stipend to fund travel from summer research. The writing process for the dissertation begins at the LSE and is completed in June.</p>

                <h2>Summer Research</h2>
                <p>This past June, I conducted archival research for my dissertation at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta. Immersing myself in the archives, I developed a range of skills critical to historical research. Navigating through a vast array of diverse documents related to President Carter’s Middle East peace negotiations, I honed my ability to identify and extract pertinent information from primary sources. I learned to meticulously catalog and organize data, ensuring that every piece of evidence was accurately documented and easily retrievable. Engaging with the archival materials also sharpened my critical thinking and analytical skills, as I worked to piece together historical narratives from fragmented records. Additionally, this experience underscored the importance of precision and attention to detail in research, as well as the need for patience and perseverance in uncovering hidden insights. My time at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library not only enriched my dissertation but also deepened my understanding of the archival research process. 

                    My deep investigation into the U.S. government also provided me with a new perspective on foreign relations and how the White House itself thinks. I was fascinated to see journalism clippings in the folders of policy makers, the various drafts and versions of documents before being sent out or signed, and most of all correspondences that engaged in diplomatic conversation and negotiation. I gained a deeper understanding of internal decision making, East-West balances of power, diplomatic tactics, and the subtleties of international negotiations.</p>
