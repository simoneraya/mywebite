                <h2>The Dissertation</h2>
                <p>The dissertation is the core component and significant undertaking in the International History MA/MSc program. The process began upon entry at Columbia, working closely with faculty members across departments to develop a working thesis. The first important step in the process is the literature review. This ensured I read the entire field, to appropriately situate my intervention within the existing literature. Following, I used the four month summer period to conduct multi-archival primary research. I was a recipient of the Columbia University Alliance Fellowship - a stipend to fund travel from summer research that sent me across the U.S. to a variety of public and private archives. The writing process for the dissertation takes place at the LSE and is completed in June.</p>
                <p>The project examines how U.S. policy, notably through arms sales, contributed to a lasting yet cautious peace between Egypt and Israel—a peace that remained a fixture in the region. Carter, whose administration was the first to champion a foreign policy rooted in human rights, initially promoted a multilateral vision that recognized Palestinian national claims within a broader framework. Yet, American policy ultimately shifted toward a narrower, bilateral agreement underpinned by military support for Egypt. This project explores the complex, often contradictory relationship between military imperialism, human rights, and peace, where weapons were deployed as instruments of diplomacy. I trace how the U.S.  moved from Carter's broader vision to a limited peace, questioning if American policy and bureaucratic inertia, particularly around arms sales, inevitably led to the bilateral peace agreement. This project explores how the U.S. reliance on arms sales as a diplomatic tool linked military support inextricably with peace efforts, resulting in a "cold peace" that has remained entrenched in the region.</p>

                <h2>Summer Research</h2>
                <p> I conducted research in Atlanta Georgia, College Park Maryland, and New York City. Beginning at the Jimmy Carter Library (JCL) in Atlanta; I went for two weeks in June to investigate the Carter Administration’s approach to peace negotiation and diplomacy in the Middle East. I focused on declassified documents on the Administration’s foreign policy, including records on arms sales, newspaper clippings and journalism, meeting memos, agendas, draft treaties, and communications. The Presidential Daily Briefs and the personal  correspondence between key U.S. actors shed light on the internal decision-making processes behind U.S. mediation and diplomacy. I began to get a feel for government thought and behaviour; helping me imagine a map of the actions and actors that played out to create this historical moment. </p>
                <p> In New York, I consulted the American Jewish Committee, and the American Jewish Historical Society Archives to gain some Israeli and Jewish American perspective on American intervention in the Middle East. </p>
                <p> What concluded my archival research in the U.S. this summer, was my trip to College Park Maryland, at the National Archive and Record Administration (NARA).
                    I explored U.S. foreign policy documents, memorandums and communications on President Carter’s human rights commitments as well as the Middle East peace process.</p>
