            <h2>Political Consulting</h2>
            <p> At The Advance Group (TAG) in New York, I served as a political consulting intern from March to August 2024. During this time, I worked closely with consultants and clients to identify critical challenges and develop strategic solutions to streamline operations within both electoral campaigns and non-profit organizations. My role involved navigating the complexities of policy-making, stakeholder engagement, and advocacy, offering me firsthand experience in how local and global policies intersect and can be leveraged to drive sustainable, impactful change. My primary responsibility was conducting in-depth research and preparing comprehensive reports, transforming insights into actionable strategies for our clients and colleagues. This experience has significantly deepened my understanding of the consulting landscape in the social and political sectors.</p>

            <h2>Archival Research</h2>
            <p>My training as a historian has honed my skills in archival research and organization. Through various research projects and my dissertation, I have spent the last year working in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Butler Library on Columbia’s campus. This training has ingrained a meticulous attention to detail, and a deep respect for the preservation and organization of historical records. I am adept at handling and cataloguing various types of archival materials, from paper documents to object collections, ensuring their integrity and accessibility for future use. My strength in analyzing and interpreting archival data is complemented by a strong foundation in archival standards, concepts, practices, and ethics. My training and familiarity with both digital and paper archives, has not only equipped me with technical skills and hands on experience, but also a genuine interest in archival work.</p>

            <h2>Film</h2>
            <p>I’ve had the incredible opportunity to work in the film industry, where I was involved in both a television show and a feature film in 2021-2022. Through this experience, I learned fast-paced nature of film production, where every day brought new challenges and creative solutions. As the assisant property master, my main tasks involved the procurement and cataloguing of props, department accounting, and assisting with creating the department budget. Transitioning to the movie set, I discovered the meticulous attention to detail and the extended timelines that come with creating a cinematic experience. Both projects honed my skills, broadened my perspective on storytelling, and deepened my passion for the art of filmmaking.</p>

            <h2>Translation</h2>
            <p>Taking a translation class at Columbia University was a transformative experience that ignited my passion for language and translation. In this class, I learned how to read, process and translate French documents, delving into the nuances and complexities that come with conveying meaning, and the ‘essence’ of French into English. Translation has deepened my appreciation for the balance between fidelity to the original text and the necessity of adaptation, sparking my interest in translation theory and the politics of language/translation. Beyond my interest, my translation skills have proved to be extremely practical and useful in research settings when I am quickly trying to get through documents and come across a French text. Working in archives, the sport is get through as many files as quickly as you can. Accordingly, having translation tools (a requirement of my degree), makes research more equitable as there isn’t a neglect of sources in different languages. In an effort to maintain a range of perspectives and voices in research, including those from a different language bolsters the integrity of the research. This proved to be extremely practical during my archival research this summer where I came across correspondences between the American ambassador in Lebanon and his Lebanese colleagues that were all in French.</p>
