            <h2>Very Mindful, Very Demure: The Meme of the Summer and What It Tells Us About Viralization </h2></p>
                <h3>August 24, 2024</h3>

                <p>A new phrase has taken over social media feeds: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joolieannie/video/7399736793119247662?is_from_webapp=1&web_id=7411164954873857542">"Very Mindful, Very Demure."</a>. It’s become the meme of the summer, exploding on social media, brand campaigns, netflix categories and in colloquial North American language. The phrase comes from a TikTok video of content creator Jools Lebron, which, depending on who you ask, is either hilarious or just... there. Yet, despite its simplicity, it exploded into a viral phenomenon.</p>

                <p>How did this happen? In the ever-accelerating cycle of internet culture, content doesn’t necessarily need to be clever or interesting to go viral. It just needs to hit that perfect combination of timing, algorithm, and ultimately randomness. Lebron’s video is a perfect example. There’s nothing particularly revolutionary about it, but it became a cultural touchstone nonetheless.</p>

                <p>This is where viralization comes into play. Viralization refers to the way content gains momentum simply because it’s viral—not because it’s funny, witty, or memorable. The more people see it, the more they share it, and the cycle repeats. As it spreads, it seems people start liking it not necessarily for its content, but because it’s everywhere. It’s become a part of the mainstream cultural fabric, and it feels like you need to be in on the joke, even if there’s no punchline.</p>

                <p>Soon after the video blew up, it was picked up by marketing teams across industries suspciously fast. Suddenly, “Very Mindful, Very Demure” became a tagline for ads, Instagram captions for brands, and part of retail campaigns. Even Gilmore Girls, an early 2000s television show with a very mindful, and very demure young lead actress blew up again. This speaks to the deeper relationship between social media, marketing, and culture: content becomes a commodity, and virality is the currency. Brands don’t necessarily need to create fresh or innovative content—they just need to latch onto the viral moment.</p>

                <p>And that’s where the merging of social media culture with mainstream culture really takes off. What starts as a TikTok meme quickly becomes repurposed and reproduced, moving from internet subcultures into broader societal language. It’s no longer just an inside joke shared by a few; it becomes part of everyday speech and behaviour, used by brands and individuals alike.</p>

                <p>But here’s the thing: is it even funny? Or are people just laughing because it’s viral? There’s an increasing trend of people liking things simply because everyone else is. Viral content has a self-perpetuating nature that feeds off collective engagement, regardless of the actual substance. It’s a phenomenon that keeps our attention, not because it offers anything meaningful, but because it’s everywhere and easy to digest.</p>

                <p>This is the crux of my thought today: we’re drawn to things simply because they’ve gone viral. It’s the viralization of our attention spans. As a result, we’re left with surface-level trends that stick for a moment and then vanish just as quickly. The more we engage with things that are simply popular because they’re popular, the less room there is for truly impactful, long-lasting ideas to take root.</p>

                <p>Take movements like #MeToo or Black Lives Matter (BLM). These were momentous cultural shifts, yet they struggled with longevity. Why? In part, because they became viral movements. When something goes viral, it’s easy for people to hop on the bandwagon, to show quick support. But virality also means that attention fades quickly. Just as fast as people rally around a cause, they move on to the next trend.</p>

                <p>And that’s why something like “Very Mindful, Very Demure” is emblematic of a larger issue. The internet loves a viral moment, but that same love of virality prevents anything from sticking. Our culture becomes a cycle of trends that burn bright and fade quickly. There’s no sustained engagement—just a brief flash in the pan before we move on to the next meme, the next viral video, the next hashtag.</p>

                <p>So, when I see this meme taking over, I’m reminded of the fleeting nature of our cultural engagement. Everything, from memes to movements, feels like it’s on borrowed time. Viral today, forgotten tomorrow. And that’s why nothing seems to have lasting power anymore—because virality is the engine driving our cultural consumption, and in that world, nothing is built to last.</p>
