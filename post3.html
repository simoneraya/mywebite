            <h2>Sexual Misconduct in Academia</h2></p>
                <h3>April 12, 2024</h3>
            <p>Today, faculty members in my department at Columbia hosted a panel discussing the various ways to navigate a department with an [alleged] sexual predator. While the panel was a much needed moment of honesty, transparency, and a genuine commitment to ensuring the safety of students, frustration and disappointment filled the room. They explained the protection of tenure, intellectual status, and “cultural differences” in the department of our program partner, LSE, that undermine obvious power dynamics between students and faculty member, <a href="https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/sexual-misconduct-investigation/" target="_blank">Roham Alvandi</a>. In a disheartening but somewhat familiar way we left the meeting hearing there was nothing to be done.</p>

            <p>It troubles me to hear the coordinator of DEI, faculty, and administrators overcomplicate the blatant realities of sexual misconduct among an esteemed professor and the students in our department. </p>

            <p>But this case highlights a broader issue: a systemic failure to address sexual misconduct in academia, an environment where scholars devote their lives to understanding gendered violence, oppression and intersectional inequalities.</p>

            <p>The private nature of sexual misconduct leaves little evidence behind, making these cases difficult to process in a judicial system reliant on tangible evidence. How disappointing is it, that an investigation into sexual misconduct between students and a powerful faculty member are contingent on tangible evidence. How disappointing is it, that we must fight and call for a "believe women" approach in the very arena that invented such language. Only through such a paradigm shift can we begin to dismantle the entrenched systems of silence and complicity that perpetuate sexual misconduct in the academy.</p>
