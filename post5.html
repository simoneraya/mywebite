            <h2>Trump's Triumph: America’s Enduring Misogyny</h2>
            <h3>November 12, 2024</h3>
    
            <p>America’s normalization of the subjugation of women isn’t just a disturbing social phenomenon; it is a political reality that had shaped and driven the electoral outcome. Trump’s recent success signals a resounding affirmation of misogynistic ideals deeply rooted in American society. With his victory, we are forced to confront a grim reality: American society’s animosity toward women’s bodies, rights, and autonomy has not only been accepted but openly advocated for.</p>
           
            <h4>More Than Transactionalism: How Trump’s Foreign Policy Reflects His Stance on Women</h4>
            <p>Trump’s foreign policy has always been one of blatant transactionalism—a philosophy where loyalty, alliances, and even basic decency are abandoned if they don’t serve an immediate benefit. This philosophy is also mirrored in his treatment of women, viewing them less as equals and more as pawns in a grander strategy of dominance and control. For him, it’s about power, coercion, and victory no matter whose rights get co-opted along the way. This transactional view is reflected not only in Trump’s dealings abroad but also in his unashamed objectification of women. In his speeches, public comments, and policies, he makes no apologies for reducing women’s rights over their own bodies, to bargaining chips. His treatment of women as objects to be managed rather than citizens deserving autonomy and self-determination, has given legitimacy to a worldview that many Americans apparently embrace.</p>
            
            <h4>The Apocalyptic Vision and Fascist Rhetoric</h4>
            <p>Trump’s apocalyptic campaign rhetoric often paints the world as a dark, dangerous place in need of a strongman to restore order. By positioning himself and his team as the realists who alone understand the dangers, he taps into an authoritarian urge to enforce control at all costs. This approach finds easy parallels in gender politics, where the fear of losing control over women and their bodies is deeply embedded in cultural attitudes. His rhetoric of impending doom—an “us versus them” mentality—conveniently includes women as a category to be subdued.</p>
            <p>And there’s a reason this fascist rhetoric resonates. Trump represents a return to a rigid, male-dominated hierarchy that promises security and predictability, both at home and abroad. Women’s autonomy threatens this order; their voices challenge the certainty of patriarchal control. His supporters hear a defense not only of borders but of traditional gender hierarchies and male domination/decision making.<p>

            <h4>America’s Choice—No Mistake This Time</h4>
            <p>In 2016, one could argue that Americans were unaware of what they were electing. But now? The U.S. is left without excuses. Trump has been explicit about who he is and what he stands for. Since his initial election, we have seen his convictions, accusations of sexual assault, and lawsuits around sexual misconduct. Trump’s record is public, and he remains unabashedly clear about his intentions. Yet he was still embraced by millions. Words cannot describe the outrage and sadness I feel, that [perceived] appealing economic or immigration  policies outweigh autonomy for women on the American political agenda. This choice, made with full awareness, reveals the depth of society’s ingrained misogyny—a misogyny that readily excuses, and even celebrates, a man who embodies violent and degrading attitudes toward women.</p>
            <p>Trump’s support demonstrates a collective shrug at the harm he poses to not only women’s rights, but  safety. In re-electing him, voters aren’t just supporting a political candidate; they are validating his treatment of women and rejecting any progress toward a society where women are trusted and respected enough to make decisions about their own body. His success confirms that for many Americans, misogyny isn’t a dealbreaker—it’s part of the appeal.<p>
            <p>Trump’s triumph is a reminder that misogyny in American society is alive, strong, and politically potent. Recognizing this requires confronting the reality that America’s hatred of women is a strategic asset, used to manipulate, control, and mobilize. Ignoring it won’t make it disappear; it demands public recognition, discussion, and a commitment to fight it at every level. The task ahead is difficult, and it begins with calling out the normalcy of hatred toward women in America. Misogyny isn’t something to work around or “compromise” with; it’s an enduring political force that will continue to shape the our world until it is finally and forcefully challenged.<p>

            <p>So, if you’ve made it to the end of this article, I not only urge, but <i>empower<i> you to have these conversations. Say it like it is. Make people uncomfortable. Let’s try and put an end to the celebration of American misogyny. <p>
                    
            <p>And to my male friends who purport #NotAllMen, my message to you is this: if 1 in 10 men are shit and 9 are doing nothing about it, they might as well not be there. We need you now more than ever. <p>
