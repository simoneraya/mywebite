            <h2>Protectionism vs. Security: How the US-China Chip War Redefines Global Trade</h2>
            <h3>December 3, 2024</h3>
            <p>The battle over semiconductors has become a critical front in the U.S.-China competition for global dominance. Since 2019, the United States has imposed <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced">escalating export controls</a> aimed at restricting China's access to chips and the equipment needed to manufacture them.</p>
            <p>These trade controls, while disruptive, have proven to be quite leaky. Companies like Nvidia have sidestepped restrictions by producing downgraded chips that meet export requirements.  China's response has been to double down on indigenization, pouring resources into building a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain. While progress has been uneven, this strategy reflects a broader trend of disengaging, with both nations seeking to reduce mutual dependencies.</p>
            <p>The chip war underscores a seismic shift in global trade norms. The rules-based order championed by the WTO has given way to a power-driven system, where economic policies are increasingly weaponized. Smaller nations face the brunt of this transition, as major powers leverage their influence to achieve strategic goals.</p>
            <p>For example, Vietnam's post-WTO experience highlights how trade liberalization can limit developing countries' industrial policy and economic mobility. While foreign direct investment surged, it focused on low-value sectors, restricting Vietnam’s ability to advance technologically or protect local industries. WTO rules constrained the country’s economic sovereignty, locking it into a dependency on foreign capital.</p>
            <p>Yet, some developing nations, like Indonesia, are finding ways to assert agency. By banning nickel ore exports and compelling companies to process resources domestically, Indonesia has spurred industrial growth, showcasing how strategic policies can work outside traditional frameworks.</p>
            <p>The U.S.-China chip war raises fundamental questions about the future of globalization and trade. Are export controls a legitimate tool to safeguard national security, or are they merely protectionism cloaked in geopolitical language? Can smaller nations carve out a place in a system dominated by power plays, or will they remain locked in an iron cage of limited policy options?</p>
            <p>As the technological and economic rivalry unfolds, its ripple effects will shape the global economy for decades to come, making it essential to navigate this landscape with foresight and adaptability. For the U.S. and China, the stakes couldn’t be higher: the winner doesn’t just gain an economic edge but defines the future of AI-based military dominance, and the balance of global power. </p>
