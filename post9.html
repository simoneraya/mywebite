            <h2>Columbia Under Siege: Collaboration, Not Capitulation 
            </h2>
            <h3>March 26, 2025</h3>

            <p>Columbia University is not just an institution—it is an intellectual powerhouse, a crucible for debate, and a place where ideas that shape the world are forged. It is, without question, one of the most dynamic and fruitful places on earth and an envy of the world. And yet, it now finds itself at the centre of an alarming display of federal overreach, one that threatens not just Columbia, but the very principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy in the United States.</p>

            </p> However, as Professor Khalidi called out in his <a href=“https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/25/does-columbia-merit-the-name-of-university” target=“_blank”>Guardian article </a> yesterday morning, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html” target="_blank">events since last Friday </a> reveal Columbia operates less as a university committed to knowledge and inquiry and more as a business. One where administrative priorities often align more with financial and reputational management than with the institution’s intellectual mission and community. The response to recent federal pressure reflects this reality. Rather than acting as a principled defender of academic freedom, Columbia’s leadership appears to be managing a crisis in a way that protects institutional interests rather than the integrity of the university itself.</p>
        
            </p> It appears to me and my peers at Columbia that our administrators are using this as an opportunity to achieve goals that they’ve wanted to reach all along. So rather than a capitulation, this more like a collaboration, with Columbia’s leadership taking this opportunity to deflect responsibility to Trump for decisions that they would tried to take on their own. </p>
        
            </p> But the most worrisome part of this collaboration is the risks of authoritarian encroachment in the academy and the precedent it sets for other, smaller academic institutions </p>
        
             <p>On March 20th, my department sent out a letter warning of the dangers of authoritarian control. A response to Columbia University's decision to cave to the demands of the federal government in hopes of potentially being able to negotiate back the $400 million withdrawal of federal funding. Their message was clear: the federal government’s actions against Columbia—the revocation of funding, the increased scrutiny, the pressure to conform—are not just political manoeuvres; they are part of a broader erosion of the freedoms that allow universities to thrive. What’s alarming is that Columbia appears to want this. The institution is not just bending to the political winds; it is actively aligning itself with a Trumpian agenda of silencing dissent and shutting down protest. Columbia, it seems, is embracing the very forces that threaten academic freedom, eager to suppress the voices of its own students and faculty in exchange for financial stability and institutional favor. </p>
        
            <p>As the letter from my department rightly pointed out, in the past, Columbia has faced moments of intense internal conflict. The protests and demonstrations throughout the 20th century were reactions to the political and social realities of the time. While those moments were tumultuous, they were also opportunities for the university to reaffirm its commitment to academic freedom and social justice. Today, however, the landscape has shifted. This is not just about political dissent or disagreement; it is about the state's capacity to control the very content of thought and inquiry at our university. The danger now lies not in our ability to challenge authority, but in the potential silencing of that very challenge.</p>
        
            <p> At the heart of this crisis is a larger question: what happens when a university—one that has produced Nobel laureates, global leaders, and groundbreaking research—immediately collaborates with Trump and sets the precedent of bending to the carrot-and-stick policies of power? The consequences of such a precedent are chilling. If Columbia, with all its influence and legacy, doesn’t even bother to fight and set a different precedent, what does that mean for institutions with far less power who actually want to protect critical thinking and free knowledge production. </p>
        
            <p>And yet, this is precisely why I am proud to be part of my department. In a moment of uncertainty, when it would be easy to remain silent, they have spoken up. They have called this what it is—a collobarative authoritarian encroachment on higher education. And they have affirmed what so many of us already know: Columbia is worth fighting for.</p>
